        Hi, my name is Jeffrey Ng. As a suggestion from a colleague, I began my career pivot into Tech in Aug 2020 when
        I obtained my graduation certificate in Data Science from Flatiron School.

        As the pandemic progressed, job search became difficult and I was not able to secure a DS position.
        Alternatively, I
        worked in an Advertising agency as a Media Planner beginning in early 2022. As an initial entry to the
        corporate world, I refined my team-building, client-facing, and soft skills previously learned in my career
        in hospitality
        and customer service.

        I developed several projects during the pandemic, most notably a recommendation system using NLP with the
        SpaCy library that used word embeddings and linear algebra to make movie recommendations. I also volunteered
        for Datakind and learned Tableau to effectively tell data stories and delineate data.</p>

        My pivot into tech was reignited when I began pursuing the Springboard Software Engineering bootcamp
        certificate in early April of 2023 while continuing my commitment with Publicis Media. Took a hiatus from
        the bootcamp and finally re-enrolled in November of 2023

        At Springboard, I met unique coding challenges each step of the way. In early February, I began a LLC named
        JN Web Solutions as a website solutions company that built business webpages for private businesses. I am
        looking for further opportunities.
